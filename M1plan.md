# E1M1 starting mission

(can we call it that)

* The mission is started immediately. The player gets an email, but of course they cannot respond

* It is however outlined in a .txt on their PC

* ***You have to get an a better xserver***

* ***The IP of a server is there***

  * servers don't need xservers. This is true irl, since they don't need graphics.

  | security | reward     |
  | -------- | ---------- |
  | FTP, SQL | SSH, HTTPS |

  
  * `scan` and connect to another server on the same network

    | security             | reward             |
    | -------------------- | ------------------ |
    | SSH, HTTPS, FTP, SQL | SMTP, SSL, Torrent |

  * this server has logs about another \<hackerman meme here\> getting access to the server. They got kicked out, but their IP is mentioned. Also in IRC logs in case the player already cleared `/log/`.

* `connect` to that \<hackerman\>'s IP. It's a laptop, so it actually should have an xserver.

  | security                                     | reward                                                       |
  | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
  | proxy, firewall, all the ports, (long) trace | an xserver, and all the quality of life programs (netmap, music, etc) |

* That was the Will trial, you can now respond to the email sent at the start. You are given an IRC node to connect to, there you get a mission hub. Then we're in XML hell for another week at least.
