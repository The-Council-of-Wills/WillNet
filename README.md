# WillNet
This is a Hacknet extension that focuses on the chaotic "Will Council."

Completion of Hacknet is recommended.

```
Some time after the events of Bit, you have been scouted by The Council of Wills. 
They're actually quite a friendly bunch; And what's more, they claim to have a working copy of Hacknet you want. 
There's work to be done.
```

## Development
Symlink `src` to a folder under your Hacknet install's `Extensions` folder.

* Windows Command Prompt (Admin)
  - `mklink /d <extensionsFolder>/WillNetExtension <repoFolder>/src`
* Unix
   - `ln -s <repoFolder>/src <extensionsFolder>/WillNetExtension`
