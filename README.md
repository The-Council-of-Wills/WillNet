# WillNet
This hacknet extension is made to be played almost entirely in the terminal, *like a real hacker*.

If you don't know how to play hacknet using mainly the keyboard, we suggest you step away.

## Development
Symlink `src` to a folder under your Hacknet install's `Extensions` folder.

* Windows Command Prompt (Admin)
  - `mklink /d <extensionsFolder>/WillNetExtension <repoFolder>/src`
* Unix
   - `ln -s <repoFolder>/src <extensionsFolder>/WillNetExtension`
