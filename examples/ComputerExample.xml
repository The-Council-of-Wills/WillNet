  AllowsDefaultBootModule is default to true and means that when you connect to a node
  it will automatically launch it's program (the last daemon defined in this file) and
  put it up on the display module.

  <!-- This positions this computer near the target on the network map
       Position is it's position radially around it, and total is the 
       number of radially surrounding nodes it has - this way you can create
       cool looking networks
       
       ExtraDistance should be between -0.6 and 0.3 - anything bigger will seem really far away, and can cause problems.
       0.1 is a good distance.
       
       the "force" tag ensures that this node is positioned exactly where it's defined here, regardless of overlaps with other nodes etc.
       It basically prevents the checks that ensure stability, but guarantees that it'll be placed close.
