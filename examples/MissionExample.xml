Hacknet mission descriptor file

Note: This format is pretty hacked together, and is a lot clunkier than the computer loader one.
Not changing this was part of my "No re-writes" policy for Hacknet, so some of the elements are
very strict about their ordering and case sensitivity. Be careful, and test!

id : the mission ID - this isn't used in-code but is sometimes useful in debugging and testing.

activeCheck : if this is set to true, when this mission is active, Hacknet will test for this mission being complete
              every frame, instead of only when the player responds to an email. This is very useful for creating delays,
              and for situations where the player is contacted from outside an existing chain.
              
shouldIgnoreSenderVerification : This prevents the check to ensure that the player responded to the right sender
                                 when checking for mission completion.

  <!-- missionStart (Optional - just remove it to not use it) allows you to define a function that gets run when a mission is Loaded in. 
  If suppress is set to true, it will only activate when the mission email is sent - 
  otherwise it will activate when it is loaded. This is very important to remember when 
  writing missions designed for use in a hub server - those missions are loaded when the save game is loaded
  or a new game is started.
  
  val: This field lets you pass in integer data to the specified function
  
  The content field is the function name. Following are the available functions:
  
  setFaction:FACTION_ID
  -Used like setFaction:entropy, sets the player's current faction to the faction with the given idName
  
  addRank
  -This adds val in rank to the player's current active faction
  
  addRankFaction:[FACTION NAME]
  -this adds the val to the specified faction. I.E: "addRankFaction:CSEC"
  
  addFlags:flagname1,flagname2,flagname3,etc
  Adds the defined (1 or more) flags to the current session. Flags can unlock missions and do other tasks
  
  removeFlags:flagname1,flagname2,flagname3,etc
  Removes the listed flags if they exist.
  
  changeSong
  -changes to the song defined in val:

  loadConditionalActions:DLC/ActionScritps/HermeticAlchemistsActions.xml
     
    setHubServer:[SERVER ID]
    - Sets the server with the given ID to be the new hub server visually on the netmap.
    - this adds the little spinny things around it, like CSEC has in the base game.
    
    setAssetServer:[SERVER ID]
    - Sets the server with the given ID to be the new asset server visually on the netmap.
    - this adds the little star inside it
    
    
    playCustomSong:[PATH_TO_SONG]
    -Fades the music into the song file specified. Needs the whole path like: Music/Song.ogg
    -Songs must be in Ogg Vorbis (.ogg) format
    -Songs will not play on the XNA branch! 
    
    playCustomSongImmediatley:[PATH_TO_SONG]
    -Plays the specified song above without the fade in - instantly snaps to it.

   The rest of the functions you'll see in the game's core missions are custom ones written to be triggered a single time, with custom code.

   see what I can do.

  <!-- This defines the path to the next mission file. The mission file at this path will be loaded, and email sent when the current mission is completed.-->
  <!-- The IsSilent flag is... admittedly in a terrible place here. It silenced THIS mission, not the next one. This means that if you set
  IsSilent to be true here, this mission will not send and email when it is loaded.-->
  
  <!-- Important detail about mission completion: For a reply to work, the mission the player is currently on my have the same email sender field as the email
  they reply to in their inbox. This means that if you have a silent connector mission, make sure it has the same sender filled in in the email field.-->
  
  <!-- If you want there to be no mission following this one (For example, the email mission that introduces you to a hub server)
  set nextMission to "NONE"-->
  <nextMission IsSilent="false">NONE</nextMission>

  <!-- Next up are Branch missions (Optional)
  Branch missions are loaded during the load step of this mission, and are held in parallel.
  Every frame (if ActiveCheck) or every time an email is responded to, the mission system will
  check the goals of the current mission (this file), and if it doesn't pass them, it will
  check (in order) the goals of all the branch missions defined here. If successful, the branch mission's
  "nextMission" will be loaded.
  
  This allows you to put in branching story paths, variable responses, and allow different responses for various goals.
  It's a bit finicky to use, so I recommend testing all branch structures you put in very carefully.
  
  Note that the branch mission's email will not be sent - they are all loaded in silent mode.-->

    any email from the same sender. This doesn't affect basic and normal missions, so if you're not doing anything too fancy,
    don't worry about it.-->
    <sender>Matt</sender>
    <subject>Test Mission Email</subject>
    <body>This is the body of the email.
Be careful with your formatting! The Hacknet parser does not account for auto-whitespace added to the left here.
Email contents are very important - small changes in wording can dramatically change how easy or hard a mission is.
Be very conscious about how much you are hinting at and guiding the player, and understand that it will be much harder
for everyone that's not you.

Good luck,
-Matt

    <!-- The attachments are the clickable items at the bottom of the email with a small "+"
    You can have as many attachments as you want, of any kind, but I recommend keeping the number small
    whenever possible, so the player can be focused on a single goal, and not be too overwhelmed.
    Even if you have no attachments, make sure you include the opening and closing tag (with nothing inside)
    They are required for the formatting.

    <attachments>
      <note title="An example note">Experiment with note formatting!
Remember that the note space is very small, so text overflow onto new lines happens quickly.

Guide the player! Hacknet missions are very frustrating when the player has too little direction and cant continue.
