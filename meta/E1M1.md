# E1M1 starting mission

(can we call it that)

* The mission is started immediately. The player gets an email, but of course they cannot respond

* It is however outlined in a .txt on their PC

* ***You have to get an a better xserver***

* ***The IP of a server is there***

  * servers don't need xservers. This is true irl, since they don't need graphics.

  | security | reward     |

  * `scan` and connect to another server on the same network

    | SSH, HTTPS, FTP, SQL | SMTP, SSL, Torrent |

  * this server has logs about another \<hackerman meme here\> getting access to the server. They got kicked out, but their IP is mentioned. Also in IRC logs in case the player already cleared `/log/`. It's also on a LAN with a few workstations that the player can't hack just yet, which can hold a few hints for after the player chases down hackerman.

* `connect` to that \<hackerman\>'s IP. It's a laptop, so it actually should have an xserver.

* That was the beginning of the Will Trial. Move an, hack everything.
