  \_ gain admin to end E3
  \_ S = EVERYTHING
  \_ L = THE GREAT FIREWALL OF DOOM // return to this in E4 doc

Order of completion, from top to bottom:

M1      M2  <- v. easy
    M3      <- slightly hard
    M4      <- slightly harder
    M5      <- v. hard


M1
  \_ Getting the netmap // so yes you can skip it. Should you? Not so much.

  \_ L
    \_ DEC encrypted netmap bit of hacknet
    \_ phone
      \_ the DEC password


well that was a short, easy, refreshing mission.
as will be the next.

M2
  \_ SSL - standard get your portcraker mission - small

  \_ L
    \_ some decent security, no firewall
    \_ SSL portcracker right there
    \_ <tracker/> reminds the player that they need to be on guard, setting up for difficulty in following missions

these missions will be harder. We just needed portcrackers, but now you're hacking corporations, companies, other big things.

M3
  \_ RTSP - uuuh something to do with youtube because that's kinda what the protocols for? Small tho.

M4
  \_ Getting the GUI display :. a website daemon somewhere so the player can do something funny

M5
  \_ KBT - request to place somone wrongly on a DNR. The player doesn't have to do this ;) as they only need the portcracker, but if they don't stop to think, it's likely they will// requires SSL, large network :. netmap, player advised to have all parts described above first.
