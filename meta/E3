at this point we can just leave xservers in. The player has one, so...

xserver starts with: RAM, terminal, main GUI (no netmap)

P
  \_ bin: HTTP, SQL, FTP, SSH, Torrent, EosDeviceScan, comshell
  \_ WILLCOME.txt -> /el style Will node
  
Will /el style server
  \_ contains leads on all the following missions
  \_ gain admin to end E3
  \_ S = EVERYTHING
  \_ L = THE GREAT FIREWALL OF DOOM // return to this in E4 doc

Order of completion, from top to bottom:

M1      M2  <- v. easy
    M3      <- slightly hard
    M4      <- slightly harder
    M5      <- v. hard


M1
  \_ Getting the netmap // so yes you can skip it. Should you? Not so much.

  \_ L
    \_ DEC encrypted netmap bit of hacknet
    \_ phone
      \_ the DEC password


well that was a short, easy, refreshing mission.
as will be the next.

M2
  \_ SSL - standard get your portcraker mission - small

  \_ L
    \_ some decent security
    \_ SSL portcracker right there
    \_ <tracker/> reminds the player that they need to be on guard, setting up for difficulty in following missions

these missions will be harder. We just needed portcrackers, but now you're hacking corporations, companies, other big things.

M3 you have to hack MeTube, a site for vloggers and gamers. - you need to remove someone's account for reasons - that person steals this other person's stuff, but as they have more money they would just win in court pretty much by default. Little information is given, however, which -> drama in the comments. You just need the portcraker, but it's the player's choice if they want to delete the stuff.
  \_ RTSP - uuuh something to do with youtube because that's kinda what the protocols for? Small tho.

  \_ MainServer

    \_ R: delete account to "end mission" // because you kinda don't have to


M4
  \_ KBT - request to place somone wrongly on a DNR. The player doesn't have to do this ;) as they only need the portcracker, but if they don't stop to think, it's likely they will// requires SSL, large network :. netmap, player advised to have all parts described above first.
