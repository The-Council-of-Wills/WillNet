You are being written to by the Elite of the Elite, and we extend another invitation towards you, after you have outdone yourself yet again.
To do this you must pass another test: this time there may be consequences.

We know of a certain 1337 madlad using one of Binbenbos' DSes to hack time itself. This can be done because of some weird-ass firmware, though how it works is strictly secret.

The problem is of course, that DSes were programmed with conscience, so as to make playing games on them more fun. This means his new project may become quite dangerous.

We need you to take a look at his work, upload some logs if we should see them to the drop server - we gave you the IP earlier.

In short: investigate this IP
