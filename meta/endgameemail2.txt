The DS is hacking the Department of Defense's IP range

You'll probably need some way to find and analyze deleted files - no sane DS consience hacks the DoD without clearing logs - so we're uploading some tools to the drop server - make sure to take them before you proceed.

There is also a program there, sequencer.exe, that you'll need to make the connections to proceed.

Look around for logs, connections, anything - get to the DS and delete its conscience.dll.
You may also want to delete hacknetv2 - some would say such a dangerous device should never exist.

We're sure this is incredibly stressing for you, no less that you'll see through the camera of the DS on your screen, and the 1337 madlad in question's face will be on your screen. But do not fret, we will do all we can do keep you calm with music.

Good luck, Will.
