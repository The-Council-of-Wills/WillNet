&#13;&#10;Your current xserver has basic functionality:
&#13;&#10;you should be able to backup, shutdown, see your IP,
&#13;&#10;and connect to your email server (not recommended nor
&#13;&#10;nessary), and access a barebones command shell. You
&#13;&#10;should also have a few tools on your system.
&#13;&#10;
&#13;&#10;For complete inauguration, you must find a complete
&#13;&#10;xserver compatible with this installation.
&#13;&#10;We have set up a small series of challenges, starting
&#13;&#10;at the IP at the bottom of this message. Continue
&#13;&#10;until you find an xserver.
