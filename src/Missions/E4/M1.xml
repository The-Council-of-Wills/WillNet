You are being written to by the Elite of the Elite, and we extend another invitation towards you, as you have outdone yourself yet again.
Our invitation stands as another test: this time there may be consequences.

We know of a certain 1337 madlad using one of Binbenbos' DSes to hack time itself. Yes. You're reading this correctly. This can be done because of some weird-ass firmware, though how it works has been kept private by the engineer.

The problem is of course, that DSes were programmed with conscience, so as to make playing games on them more fun or something insane along those lines. This means his new project may become quite dangerous.

We need you to take a look at his work, upload some logs if we should see them to the drop server - we gave you the IP earlier.

In short: investigate this IP
