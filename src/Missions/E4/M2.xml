Holy fuck.

The DS is probing the Department of Defense's IP range.

You need some way to analyze the computer's command logs stored in RAM, no sane DS consience hacks the DoD without clearing filesystem logs.

We're uploading some memory forensics tools to the download server (137.74.187.101).
There is also another program called esequencer.exe, that we've configured to target a critical entry point into the DoD.

Take these 3 programs, and when ready, start the sequencer.

Look around for logs, connections, anything - get to the DS and delete its conscience.dll.
Delete any copies of the launch codes if they're there...
You may also want to delete hacknetv2 - some would say such a dangerous device should never exist.

Good luck... WILL.
