My boy Hakan, my heart aches so.
I know I have not been the best father, and my words may never reach your heart,
but I really do love you, and I vow to change this year.
No more drinking. No more selfishness.
I know you are very technically savvy, my dear boy. I know you can swiftly
hack whatever you want, because you are more than "hackerman" - you are Hakan,
the brightest and the pride of the Lindstrom bloodline.
I hope you read these diaries, and come back home to see your family, even just
once. We're proud of you. We love you. I'm proud of you. I love you.
