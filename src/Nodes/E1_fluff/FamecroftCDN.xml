&lt;text&gt;
Dear players of Raycer Ultimate,
We are unfortunately in the position of needing to
slightly increase the prices for game currency across
our products.
We understand that this may be an unwelcome change to
the game you love, and as compensation, all players
will receive a free 50 Roadbux as a show of goodwill
to everyone who continues to stay with us despite
these changes.
Your mates on the road,
The Famecroft Crew
&lt;/text&gt;
&lt;!--
... I f***ing hate having to write these.
Every word is a layer of sugar over slimy corporate
desires, that all crumbles under the pull of the
black hole of greed the execs have now into a
meaningless swarm of fragments that pierce the
unwitting players as they too get pulled into void.
Surprised it took them this long to pull this kind
of stunt.
I just hope they actually meant a "slight" increase.
I've got half a mind to lower the prices myself,
or make everything free just to get back at them.
They probably log whatever happens on the root server,
but besides that, I bet they wouldn't know if the
files were changed...
