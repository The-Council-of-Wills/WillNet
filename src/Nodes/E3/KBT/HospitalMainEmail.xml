        A strange ip is showing up on the network every now and then, with more traffic than usual.
        I think it's very dodgy, and that an attack may be in the process of planning - obviously that would be catastrophic.
        To deal with this it would probably be better to set up a blacklist. Their ip is 145.48.30.48

        There a reason you're not setting this up yourself?
        Yeah, no worries, this was pretty quick. Already done. You don't have to worry. :P
