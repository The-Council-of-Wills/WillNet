Just a note, the other server on our LAN sometimes refuses legitimate connections. We're still figuring out why.
In the meantime, I've uploaded some crackers to /bin, which you'll probably need for remote maintenance.
Please don't abuse them, and don't let any of these crackheads get their hands on them.</file>
