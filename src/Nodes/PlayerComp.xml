This is a basic deployment of Hacknet designed by the Will Council.
Your current x-server.sys provides basic functionality.

You are able to backup, shutdown, see your IP, connect to your
email server, and access a barebones command shell.
You also have a few programs on your system under the /bin folder.

However, this meagre set of tools is far from complete.
Find a complete x-server.sys. Then find us.

We will be waiting.
