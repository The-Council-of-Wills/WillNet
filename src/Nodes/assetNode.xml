This is a basic deployment of Hacknet designed by the Will Council.
Your current x-server.sys provides basic functionality.

You are able to backup, shutdown, see your IP, connect to your
email server, and access a barebones command shell.
You also have a few programs on your system under the /bin folder.

However, this meagre set of tools is far from complete.
Find a complete x-server.sys. Then find us.

We will be waiting.

So you've not only slipped through a corportate network without a trace,
but you've bested a fellow hacker at his own game?

Consider us impressed, #PLAYERNAME#!

Now, unless hackerman got better at hiding things recently, you should
be in possesion of a new set of targets.

Get going.

Here's a quick how-to for those unfamilliar:

>SQLInject and WebServerWorm are two all too common crackers.
Like many others you'll come across, all you need to do is call them 
with the port number of the service they are designed for (nmap will help with that)
and in time, they'll bust that port wide open for a PortHack.

>DNotes is nifty, it'll dump all the notes you make with addNote to
stdout, so you can read them in the terminal.

>You can use ps to keep track of what's running, and nmap to keep track of what's open
on the host machine.

Good Luck.
