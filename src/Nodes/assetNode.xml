This is a basic deployment of Hacknet designed by the Will Council.
Your current x-server.sys provides basic functionality.

You are able to backup, shutdown, see your IP, connect to your
email server, and access a barebones command shell.
You also have a few programs on your system under the /bin folder.

We do, however, recommend a pen and some paper to keep track of the
networks you encounter, and other useful info, for now.

However, this meagre set of tools is far from complete.
Find a complete x-server.sys. Then find us.

We will be waiting.

So you've not only slipped through a corportate network without a trace,
but you've bested a fellow hacker at his own game?

Consider us impressed, #PLAYERNAME#!

Now, unless hackerman got better at hiding things recently, you should
be in possesion of a new set of targets.

Get going.

Well done.
You should now have an encrypted x-server.sys.
All the same it IS encrypted. Worry not, we know exactly the company that develops this form of encryption.
It... really isn't that strong. All the same, you'll need the DEC suite of tools.
Connect to 79.5.101.1 for an administrator's home network. You'll fine there the information you need to put yourself on the whitelist for the DEC network.
We'll stay in touch.

Now that you have whitelisted yourself for the DEC network, you need to gain further access to their network.
There is another layer, however, and the inner one is far stronger than the outer one you have already had victory over.
You now have in your home folder a Remote Code Execution script, which you must upload to their secondary internal server.
This will allow us to get the IP you will need to enter their private network, where you will find the source control server.

Here's a quick how-to for those unfamilliar:

>SQLInject and WebServerWorm are two all too common crackers.
Like many others you'll come across, all you need to do is call them 
with the port number of the service they are designed for (nmap will help with that)
and in time, they'll bust that port wide open for a PortHack.

>DNotes is nifty, it'll dump all the notes you make with addNote to
stdout, so you can read them in the terminal.

>You can use ps to keep track of what's running, and nmap to keep track of what's open
on the host machine.

Good Luck.
